    `Currently, I’m a Computer Science student at Warsaw University of Technology and a software engineer at <a href='https://www.swing.dev/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Swing</a>, where I help companies grow by making their products successful. My goal is to make web apps smooth and fast for all the users. All with use of modern web technologies.`,
    `Besides, I’m a proud co-founder of <a href='http://flatpixels.pl/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>flatpixels</a>. As for now, we’re focused on building native Mac apps, but we’ve had quite a journey in the past. From Unity games, to Ghost themes. We’ve tried it all.`,
    `Ocasionally, I work as a semi-professional photographer. Mainly taking photorelations. Find my photos on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/bartekjacak/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Instagram</a>, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/jacakfoto' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Facebook Page</a> and my <a href='https://tookapic.com/bartlomiej' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Tookapic</a> where I post them daily. One photo a day, for over 1700 days. Meaning that almost ¼ of my life is documented on everyday photos.`,
